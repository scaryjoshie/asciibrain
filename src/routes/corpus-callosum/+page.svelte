    name="corpus callosum"
    tagline="The brain's information superhighway"
    definition="The corpus callosum, a thick band of nerve fibers, connects the two hemispheres of the brain and facilitates communication between them. It allows for the exchange of information, integration of sensory and motor signals, and coordination of complex tasks requiring input from both hemispheres."
    example="For example, if you were playing a musical instrument, the corpus callosum would enable coordination between the left and right hands, allowing both hands to synchronize their movements."
