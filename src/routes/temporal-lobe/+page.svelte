    definition="The temporal lobe, located on the sides of the brain, is primarily associated with processing auditory information, language comprehension, and the formation and retrieval of long-term memories."
    example="For example, when you listen to music, the temporal lobe analyzes the sound waves, allowing you to perceive melody, rhythm, and lyrics. Also, in recalling a childhood memory, the temporal lobe is responsible for retrieving the stored information required."
