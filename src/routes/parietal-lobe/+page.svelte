<Part 
    name="parietal lobe"
    tagline="Sensory Hub"
    definition="The parietal lobe processes sensory information from the body, including touch, temperature, pain, and spatial awareness. It also plays a role in language processing and mathematical reasoning."
    example="For example, when you reach out to grab a cup of coffee, the parietal lobe integrates sensory input from your hand and coordinates the movement required to grasp the cup with the right amount of force. Additionally, when reading a book, the parietal lobe helps you understand spatial relationships between words and sentences, facilitating comprehension."
