    definition="The reticular formation is a network of neurons scattered throughout the brainstem that regulates consciousness, sleep-wake cycles, and attention. It filters sensory information and plays a role in maintaining arousal and alertness."
    example="For example, when you wake up in the morning, the reticular formation becomes active, increasing alertness and consciousness. Throughout the day, it filters incoming sensory stimuli, allowing you to focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions."
