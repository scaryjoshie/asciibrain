    definition="The hypothalamus is a vital part of the brain that controls various physiological processes, including temperature regulation, hunger, thirst, sleep, and the release of hormones from the pituitary gland."
    example="For example, when you feel hungry, the hypothalamus detects low levels of glucose in the bloodstream and triggers sensations of hunger, prompting you to seek food. Additionally, during hot weather, the hypothalamus initiates sweating to cool the body and maintain a stable internal temperature."
