    tagline="Responder to fear"
    definition="The amygdala, part of the limbic system, is responsible for processing emotions, particularly fear and aggression, and plays a crucial role in emotional responses and the formation of emotional memories."
    example="For example, when encountering a potential threat, such as a growling dog, the amygdala quickly assesses the situation, triggering a fear response. This response might include increased heart rate, heightened awareness, and the instinct to flee."
