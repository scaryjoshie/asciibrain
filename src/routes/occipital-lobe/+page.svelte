    definition="The occipital lobe, positioned at the back of the brain, interprets visual stimuli, such as shapes, colors, and motion, and helps in forming mental images and perceiving your environment."
    example="For example, when you look at a sunset, the occipital lobe processes the colors and shapes of the sky and horizon, allowing you to appreciate the background. When reading a book, the occipital lobe is able to translate written words to meaningful visual information."
