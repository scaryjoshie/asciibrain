    definition="The pons is a structure located in the brainstem that serves as a relay station, transmitting signals between different parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. It also regulates sleep, breathing, and certain aspects of facial movement."
    example="For example, when you take a breath, the pons help regulate the breathing process by coordinating signals between the respiratory centers in the brainstem and the muscles involved in breathing."
